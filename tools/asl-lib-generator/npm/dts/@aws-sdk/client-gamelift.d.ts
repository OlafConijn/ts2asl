                *         <p>A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (GameLift fleets or

                *             These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On-Demand), instance types,
                *             and Amazon Web Services Regions. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue is able to place
                *             game sessions in all of a fleet's remote locations. You can opt to filter out individual

                *             cap policies. You can also include the ARN for an Amazon Simple Notification Service

                * <p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to
                *             automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling
                *             policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's
                *             capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies:
                *             target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage
                *             fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you
                *             need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p>
                *         <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time;
                *             you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or
                *             both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have
                *             unintended consequences.</p>
                *         <p>You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling
                *             policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop
                *             just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with
                *                 <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.</p>
                *         <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html">Set Up Fleet Automatic

                *             <b>Target-based policy</b>
                *          </p>
                *         <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This
                *             metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions
                *             but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional
                *             player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based
                *             policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action
                *             is needed to maintain that target. </p>
                *         <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the
                *             capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take
                *             action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game
                *             sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return
                *             to the 10% buffer. </p>
                *         <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the
                *             policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)
                *             and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer
                *             value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is
                *             returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully
                *             created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy
                *             will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p>
                *         <p>
                *             <b>Rule-based policy</b>
                *          </p>
                *         <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and
                *             specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you
                *             can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale
                *             up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p>
                *         <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle
                *             instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity
                *             by 10%."</p>
                *         <p>A policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p>
                *         <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code>
                *             <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then
                *                 <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by
                *             <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p>
                *         <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p>
                *         <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code>
                *             <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then
                *                 <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p>
                *         <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and
                *             fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a
                *             policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling
                *             policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the
                *             fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force
                *             once the fleet actions are restarted.</p>

                *         <p>To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking
                *             configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being

        * <p>Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of

        *             build.  </p>
        *         <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A
        *             simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or
        *             link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use
        *             a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct
        *             players to an upgrade site. </p>
        *         <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional
        *             description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have
        *             multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID
        *             and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling

        *                         <code>CreateBuild</code> and specify a build name, operating system, and the

        *                     operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and also returns an
        *                     Amazon S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually
        *                     upload your build files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more information,

        *             servers in the game server group are deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources.

        *             your Amazon Web Services account can use. Learn more at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a>. The information

        *         <p>Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home

        * <p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to
        *             automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling
        *             policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's
        *             capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies:
        *             target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage
        *             fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you
        *             need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p>
        *         <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time;
        *             you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or
        *             both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have
        *             unintended consequences.</p>
        *         <p>You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling
        *             policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop
        *             just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with
        *                 <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.</p>
        *         <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html">Set Up Fleet Automatic

        *         <p>
        *             <b>Target-based policy</b>
        *          </p>
        *         <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This
        *             metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions
        *             but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional
        *             player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based
        *             policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action
        *             is needed to maintain that target. </p>
        *         <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the
        *             capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take
        *             action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game
        *             sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return
        *             to the 10% buffer. </p>
        *         <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the
        *             policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)
        *             and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer
        *             value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is
        *             returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully
        *             created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy
        *             will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p>
        *         <p>
        *             <b>Rule-based policy</b>
        *          </p>
        *         <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and
        *             specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you
        *             can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale
        *             up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p>
        *         <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle
        *             instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity
        *             by 10%."</p>
        *         <p>A policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p>
        *         <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code>
        *             <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then
        *                 <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by
        *             <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p>
        *         <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p>
        *         <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code>
        *             <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then
        *                 <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p>
        *         <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and
        *             fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a
        *             policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling
        *             policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the
        *             fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force
        *             once the fleet actions are restarted.</p>

        *         <p>When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from

        *             backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of
        *             backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.</p>

        *                     and specify the current utilization status. Use this status to identify when
        *                     game servers are currently hosting games and when they are available to be
        *                     claimed.</p>

        *                     to <code>HEALTHY</code>. If a game server does not report health status for a
        *                     certain length of time, the game server is no longer considered healthy. As a
        *                     result, it will be eventually deregistered from the game server group to avoid
        *                     affecting utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60
        *                     seconds.</p>

        *                     individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require

        *                     in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may
        *                     describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at

        *                     balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of
        *                     making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you
        *                     might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players
